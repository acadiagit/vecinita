A State on the Move

A Message from the Commissioner of Education

My fellow Rhode Islanders,

Everywhere I go, when I talk with students, families, and educators, I hear the same thing: excitement about the progress we’ve made together—and an understanding that there’s still more to do.

--- CHUNK 2/7 ---
Everywhere I go, when I talk with students, families, and educators, I hear the same thing: excitement about the progress we’ve made together—and an understanding that there’s still more to do.

Our priority is simple and unwavering: to make sure every student in Rhode Island has what they need to thrive, graduate, and step into college or a career ready to succeed. We know that every child’s journey is unique. Some students will need academic support, others social or emotional help. That’s why our educators are committed to creating safe, inclusive schools where every child feels valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential.

And let’s be clear—nothing replaces being in school. Attendance matters. Students who miss 18 or more days a year—just about two a month—fall behind by an average of 20 points or more. That’s why we’ve made reducing chronic absenteeism a top priority.

--- CHUNK 3/7 ---
This year marks the third year of our Attendance Matters RI campaign—and we are seeing results. Rhode Island has reduced chronic absenteeism by 12 percentage points since 2021–22. That means more than 3.7 million hours of learning have been given back to our kids.

We’re also seeing encouraging results in academics. Math scores are now above pre-pandemic levels, and we are continuing to push forward on English Language Arts. According to the latest Education Recovery Scorecard, Rhode Island is leading New England in post-pandemic academic recovery. That is no accident — it’s a reflection of our collective commitment and hard work.

But progress takes all of us. Each of us has something to offer, and each of us must do our part.

--- CHUNK 4/7 ---
But progress takes all of us. Each of us has something to offer, and each of us must do our part.

To our students: we see you. We know these are not easy times. Many of you have had to grow up fast — caring for siblings, and sometimes even other family members, all while trying to stay on top of school. That is a lot to carry, and you shouldn’t have to carry it alone. If you’re struggling with schoolwork, stress at home, friendships, or just how you’re feeling — please reach out to a trusted adult in your school. Your teachers, counselors, principals, and staff are there for you. If you need help with basics like food or clothing, please ask. There is no shame in asking for help — we are here for you.

To our parents: if something is making it hard for your child to attend school every day, please connect with your child’s school team. Together, we can make sure your child has the support and opportunities they need to succeed.

--- CHUNK 5/7 ---
Here in Rhode Island, we will keep investing in our students because we know the truth: there is no greater driver of individual success — or our success as a state — than education. This is going to be a great year. Let’s make it count. In partnership, Angélica Infante-Green Commissioner of Education

A Bold Vision for Success

Rhode Island’s vision for education is founded on three core pillars: World-Class Talent, Excellence in Learning, and Engaged Communities. I am incredibly proud of how we are turning that vision into reality.

--- CHUNK 6/7 ---
Now more than ever we need your support to ensure we give the best education to students across our state. You can help by donating to the Fund for Rhode Island Public Education. Charitable contributions in any amount will be accepted and used to support initiatives aligned to our vision that benefit the education of our public-school students.

Thank you for your support and commitment to the future of Rhode Island children. -- Commissioner Infante-Green Read more about Commissioner Infante-Green

By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.

We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere

The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been researching and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:

In making space to do research differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered research with community impact.

Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.

DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.

#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.

Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.

Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

Descripción

--- CHUNK 14/43 ---
La Asociación de Vecinos de Olneyville (ONA) comenzó de manera informal en la década de 1990, ubicada en una iglesia local, como un foro para los vecinos de uno de los barrios más marginados de Rhode Island para abordar las condiciones de vida cotidianas. Estos líderes, principalmente de ascendencia guatemalteca, puertorriqueña, dominicana y mexicana, se dieron cuenta de que fuerzas externas estaban impulsando el desplazamiento al eliminar empleos locales, aumentar los precios de la vivienda y crear una guerra cultural contra los inmigrantes y las personas de color, jóvenes y mayores. En 2005, los nuevos líderes lideraron un desafiante proceso de “renacimiento” al aclarar la misión, la visión y los métodos de organización de la organización

En 2005, los nuevos líderes lideraron un desafiante proceso de “renacimiento” al aclarar la misión, la visión y los métodos de organización de la organización. ONA ha creado un vehículo para que miembros de la comunidad y aliados organicen iniciativas de defensa comunitaria y campañas de acción directa, con un enfoque particular en la protección y promoción de los derechos de los inmigrantes indocumentados.

English Translation

The Olneyville Neighborhood Association (ONA) began informally in the 1990’s, housed out of a local church, as a forum for neighbors in one of Rhode Island's most marginalized barrios to address day-to-day living conditions. These leaders primarily of Guatemalan, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Mexican descent realized outside forces were driving displacement by eliminating local jobs, raising housing prices, and creating a cultural war against immigrants and people of color, young and old. In 2005, new leaders led a challenging “rebirth” process as they clarified the organization's mission, vision, and organizing methods. ONA has created a vehicle for community members and allies to organize community defense initiatives and direct action campaigns, with a particular focus on protecting and advancing the rights of undocumented immigrants.

Story Spotlight

“It’s very rare people recognize you for just being a human being.”

For Ada Uzia Boaz and Chance Boas living in Tanzania’s refugee camps meant surviving in very difficult conditions. A great deal of their time was spent waiting for food rations, clean drinking water – and especially – waiting decades for a permanent home. Despite the struggles, life went on amid the suffering.

Public Benefits and Other Assistance

This page contains information on public benefits and assistance from local organizations. For information about health care in particular, click here.

Public Benefits

Use the following guide from the Economic Progress Institute to check if you qualify for public benefits.

You may also wish to get in touch with a case manager about whether you qualify for benefits.

Case management services are offered by Progreso Latino and the Refugee Dream Center. Case management can help you navigate welfare programs such as housing assistance, SNAP (food assistance), Medicaid, and RIte Care. Contact Progreso Latino by reaching out to Lissy De La Roca at ldelaroca@progresolatino.org or (401) 728-5920 ext. 31. Refugees can contact the Refugee Dream Center at (401) 300-0544.

--- CHUNK 2/5 ---
Many people are not applying for SNAP, Rite Care, Medicaid and other public benefits because they've heard about changes to the public charge rules that the federal government proposed. Here are 3 important things to know about public charge and the proposed rules:

The rules have been stopped by federal courts and cannot affect anyone now.

If you have a green card, receiving public benefits cannot affect your eligibility for U.S. citizenship (even under the proposed rules).

If your children are citizens and receive public benefits, it will not affect your eligibility for a green card (even under the proposed rules).

You can learn more about the public charge rule by visiting the public charge page or consulting with an immigration attorney.

Assistance from Local Organizations

Aside from public benefit programs, some Rhode Island organizations offer their own assistance to immigrant families.

Citizenship & Immigration

Providing low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees, and their families

What We Do

Citizenship & Immigration Services staff members provide advice and low-cost representation for citizenship and immigration processes. Our legal representation at U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) is limited to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut residents. Legal representation at the Immigration Court in Boston is also available on a case-by-case basis.

Who We Are

Our Citizenship & Immigration Services program is one of four programs in RI whose staff members are accredited by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Partial accreditation enables us to represent clients before USCIS; full accreditation additionally allows us to represent clients before the Immigration Court.

--- CHUNK 2/7 ---
Our staff — five attorneys and six accredited representatives — give consultations to thousands of individuals annually and assist an average of more than 1,500 clients each year with applications and legal representation. We are trained to handle a wide variety of immigration matters, including naturalization, permanent residence applications, family petitions, temporary protected status, deferred action, unlawful presence waivers, asylum, deportation defense, and legal services for victims of crime.

We also provide outreach on immigration matters to clients and communities throughout Rhode Island regarding the availability of low-cost services by DOJ accredited agencies, as well as the dangers of using the services of Notarios and other practitioners engaged in the unlawful practice of immigration law.

The critical work of our immigration attorneys includes representing clients in removal proceedings, specifically before the Boston and Chelmsford Immigration Courts. Our team is dedicated to vigorously defending our clients by ensuring thorough preparation and providing detailed advocacy in both state and federal court. Our attorneys are well versed in handling juvenile immigration cases with an emphasis on trauma-informed lawyering. Our team of attorneys ensures that the legal process does not further harm the child but instead helps them move toward a safer and more stable future while on a pathway to citizenship. Asylum proceedings are particularly challenging, but our lawyers are adept at securing favorable outcomes.

Immigration Help for Victims

If you are undocumented and have been a victim of domestic violence, or if you are a victim of domestic violence whose immigration status is dependant on your abuser, there may be protections in the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that can help you stay in the country safely.

Because of the complexities of immigration law, it is important to get help from a knowledgeable and trustworthy source.
