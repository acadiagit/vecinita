Empowerment

Every person has a right to have control over their mind, body and spirit.

Safety

Every person has the right to privacy and a life free from violence.

Justice

Every person and community affected by domestic violence deserves justice. We strive to reshape and create systems and policies to eliminate systemic oppression and violence of all kinds.

Authentic Partnership

We cannot end domestic violence on our own, and we intentionally invest in partnerships to accomplish our goal of eliminating violence.
