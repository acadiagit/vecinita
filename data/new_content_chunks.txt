By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.
We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere
The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been reing and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:
In making space to do re differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered re with community impact.
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.
STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.
DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.
#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.
Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

--- CHUNK 4/8 ---
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.
We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere
The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been reing and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:
In making space to do re differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered re with community impact.
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.
STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.
DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.
#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.
Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

2025 RICAS Results Show Strong Literacy Gains in Providence Public Schools and Steady Progress in Math
PROVIDENCE, RI – Earlier today, the Rhode Island Department of Education released the results of the 2025 state assessments including the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS), showing Providence public school students have rebounded above pre-pandemic levels in both English Language Arts (ELA) and math. Results show a modest climb for students in the capital city with a 2.4% increase in English Language Arts (ELA) and a 1.7% increase in math.

--- CHUNK 34/45 ---
The overall results for the Providence Public School District (PPSD) show it is continuing with positive gains in both ELA and Math. The percentage of Providence students meeting or exceeding expectations in RICAS math outpaced the statewide growth of 1.3 percentage points in the same measure and fell just shy of the state's 2.9% ELA increase. In addition, the District has become a leader in the state in the reduction of chronic absenteeism rates. PPSD’s chronic absenteeism rate saw a 6.9 percentage-point decrease between the 2023-24 and the 2024-25 school years, one of the steepest declines in the state.

By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.
We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere
The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been reing and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:
In making space to do re differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered re with community impact.
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.
STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.
DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.
#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.
Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

2025 RICAS Results Show Strong Literacy Gains in Providence Public Schools and Steady Progress in Math
PROVIDENCE, RI – Earlier today, the Rhode Island Department of Education released the results of the 2025 state assessments including the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS), showing Providence public school students have rebounded above pre-pandemic levels in both English Language Arts (ELA) and math. Results show a modest climb for students in the capital city with a 2.4% increase in English Language Arts (ELA) and a 1.7% increase in math.

--- CHUNK 6/45 ---
The overall results for the Providence Public School District (PPSD) show it is continuing with positive gains in both ELA and Math. The percentage of Providence students meeting or exceeding expectations in RICAS math outpaced the statewide growth of 1.3 percentage points in the same measure and fell just shy of the state's 2.9% ELA increase. In addition, the District has become a leader in the state in the reduction of chronic absenteeism rates. PPSD’s chronic absenteeism rate saw a 6.9 percentage-point decrease between the 2023-24 and the 2024-25 school years, one of the steepest declines in the state.

PROVIDENCE, RI – Earlier today, the Rhode Island Department of Education released the results of the 2025 state assessments including the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS), showing Providence public school students have rebounded above pre-pandemic levels in both English Language Arts (ELA) and math. Results show a modest climb for students in the capital city with a 2.4% increase in English Language Arts (ELA) and a 1.7% increase in math.

The overall results for the Providence Public School District (PPSD) show it is continuing with positive gains in both ELA and Math. The percentage of Providence students meeting or exceeding expectations in RICAS math outpaced the statewide growth of 1.3 percentage points in the same measure and fell just shy of the state's 2.9% ELA increase. In addition, the District has become a leader in the state in the reduction of chronic absenteeism rates.

By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.
We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere
The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been reing and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:
In making space to do re differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered re with community impact.
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.
STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.
DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.
#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.
Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).

By asking “Open for whom,” RIOS imagines an Open Education as the radical idea that education should be affordable, accessible, equitable, inclusive, and relevant to everyone regardless of their background.
We envision classrooms which center students as co-constructors of the learning process, in an Open Science ecosystem which democratizes knowledge, tools, and access to information. Inclusive and socially-just science education must be the core framework for investing in tomorrow’s science.

--- CHUNK 2/8 ---
For our community, RIOS is a place of Refuge, Reciprocity, Creativity, Criticality, Building, Partnerships, Civic Engagement, Solidarity, Authenticity, Openness, Reimagining, Resilience #OpenAsResistance, #ScienceAsResistance, #STEMforDemocracy For society, RIOS is shaping the future of what science can be. "Education…becomes "the practice of freedom," the means by which [people]... deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world." - Paulo Friere
The RIOS Institute leads by both vision and example - RIOS has already been reing and responding to many of the systemic and practical issues facing postsecondary STEM education. We believe:
In making space to do re differently, leveraging the collaborative culture of Open Pedagogy and Open Science, and making spaces for human-centered re with community impact.
Hegemony is not meritocracy.

--- CHUNK 3/8 ---
Hegemony is not meritocracy.
STEM classrooms can be a partner, using practices such as Open Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy transforming the power of our differences into civic engagement and learning.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the benchmarks of our professional responsibility to ensure that all of the students we are asked to serve are successful.
DEI is absolutely vital to science and the journey towards social justice in STEM makes us stronger.
#OpenAsResistance - promoting free and open platforms, tools and digital resources, and a culture of transparency and collaboration which benefit the public good.
Everyone deserves and needs computational and quantitative education, integrated with critical inquiry.
Our future depends on actively opening [participation in] science, making and sharing with other scientists (Open Science) and with the public (community-engaged and open science).
